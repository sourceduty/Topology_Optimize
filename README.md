### Example Usage

#### Star Topology Conversion Example

Converting a star topology network into a mesh topology involves transforming a structure where all nodes are individually connected to a central hub into one where each node is interconnected with every other node. In a star topology, a central server node connects directly to each client node, providing a straightforward and efficient means of communication. This setup is easy to manage and troubleshoot since all data traffic passes through the central hub, allowing for centralized control and monitoring. However, the main drawback of a star topology is its single point of failure: if the central server fails, the entire network becomes inoperable.

In contrast, a mesh topology offers a robust and resilient alternative by connecting every node directly to all other nodes, creating a web of interconnections. This redundancy ensures that the network can still operate even if multiple connections fail, significantly enhancing reliability and fault tolerance. The transition from a star to a mesh topology involves establishing direct links between all nodes, resulting in increased complexity and higher setup and maintenance costs. However, the advantages of a mesh network, such as improved redundancy, load balancing, and reduced bottlenecks, often outweigh these challenges, making it a preferable choice for critical applications requiring high availability and reliability.
